ABOUT ME:
- Name: Paolo Enerio
- Section: B54
- Program: BS Computer Science

I am a CS student. I took this course because of (3) things. First, I believe that this course will provide plenty of
job opportunities in the future. Second, my dream job is to become a game developer. Third, tech is something I take
interest on.
Upon learning of the malpractices that some of the big tech companies do, I've added some items on my goal list.
    1. Become a competent software developer to contribute to open-source projects that better serve and respect
    end users.
    2. Try to avoid working for corporations that actively do anti-consumer practices.

git commit -m "Msg" ->This is used to save changes to the repository.
git pull            ->This synchronizes your local repository to the latest update from the remote repository. This is used when
                    you want to work on the latest snapshot of a file.
